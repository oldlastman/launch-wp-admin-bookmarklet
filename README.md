Bookmarklet for get admin area of wordpress  in new tab from active website tab


There is some ways to clone tabs in every browser, I normally use crhome so this is the way:

If you need to duplicate tabs frequently, there is an easy way to do so with shortcuts. In Google Chrome, it’s actually possible to duplicate a tab by simply right clicking on the tab and clicking “Duplicate” on the menu. If you want to use your keyboard on a PC, an easy  shortcut that works for both Chrome and Firefox is to press Alt+D, which brings the selection to the address bar, highlighting the URL. With the Alt key still held down, press Enter to open up a new tab with the highlighted URL.
